<h1>0320 Calculate Pairs Sub Row Formula</h1>



<p>The *pairs have some unique characteristics. 
<br>Looking at a group (g) , any group and the rows or records within a group (g) reveals some 
additional math and symmetry. </p>

<p>There are four charts below. (g)0 , (g)1 , (g)2 , (g)3 ; each is offset from the other by plus thirty. </p>


<strong>
<em>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; a) (g)0 starts at 0</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; b) (g)1 starts at 30</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; c) (g)2 starts at 60</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; d) (g)3 starts at 90</p>
</em>
</strong>



<p>Within a group (g) there are eight rows (r) one for each
*fam formula. Then the solutions are placed under each *pair. On the left side
of the gray bar is sorting of the *pairs by group (g) by row (r) by *fam ( as PSleft and PSright ). </p>

<p>To the right of the grey bar all of group zero (g)0 and row one (r1) are sorted together. 
<br>Then (g)0 (r2) and on. The *pairs are sorted from low to high. Inside the cells with borders are the values. 
<br>This will be the focus of the math going to the right.</p>

<p>The two values (PSleft and PSright) within a row all add to the same value. 
<br>See the ‘sum’ column. The next column ‘sum / 30’ is the value of division. 
<br>The next column ‘*fam value’ is a guess of the *fam. 
<br>Take and subtract ‘*fam value’ from ‘sum / 30’ to make the column ‘subtract *fam value’. 
<br>Divide that column by 30 to get the group (g).</p>

<p>Look at each of the next four charts. </p>

<p>This leads to the general equation of:</p>

<p>
<strong>
<em>
<p style="background-color:#82e2ff;">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; = ( { ( [ *pair.PSleft + *pair.PSright ] / 30 ) - *famGuess } / 30 ) = group 
</em>
</strong>
</p>


<p>Go back to the starting premise of *wildcard ( *1 , *3 , *7 , *9 ) and *fam (*fam01 , *fam 07 , . . . , *fam29). 
<br>Then to all the sorts and formulas to get to here. 
There is a symmetry and balance for the eight equations and formulas. 
<br>But , no prime numbers can be easily decerned. We can see all numbers prime and non-prime. 
Yet a formula for primes is not clearly evident. 
<br>The only common thread is thirty (30) ; and for each *fam the next PS (prime suspect) appears to be thirty away.</p>

<p>ll of these charts are large datasets of the prior chapter. </p>

<p>The *pairs have some unique characteristics. Looking at a
pgrX (*pair / group (g) / row (r) / number ), any *pair , group and the rows or
records within a group (g) reveals some additional math and symmetry. </p>

<p>There are four charts below. (pgr0) , (pgr1) , (pgr2) , (pgr3) ; each is offset from the other by plus thirty. </p>

<p>(pgr0) starts at 0</p>

<p>(pgr1) starts at 30</p>

<p>(pgr2) starts at 60</p>

<p>(pgr3) starts at 90</p>

<p>Within a (pgrX) there are four *pairs and eight rows (r) one for each *fam formula. 
<br>Then the solutions are placed under each *pair. 
<br>On the left side of the gray bar is sorting of the *pairs by *fam ( as PSleft and PSright ). 
<br>The third row ‘r3’ has been highlighted in each sheet to help focus on the data collection.</p>

<p>All the like rows are sorted together on the right side of the gray bar. 
<br>All the *pairs of row one (r1) are sorted together. 
<br>Then (r2) are joined , and on. The *pairs are sorted from low to high. Inside the cells with borders are the values. 
<br>This will be the focus of the math going to the right.</p>


<p>The two values (PSleft &amp; PSright) within a row all add to the same value. See the ‘PSsum’ column. 
<br>The next column ‘PSsum / 30’ is the value of division. 
<br>Then the column ‘*fam value’ is the *fam. Above in blue is the subtraction value. 
<br>Take and subtract ‘*fam value’ from ‘PSsum / 30’ to make the column ‘subtract *fam value’. 
<br>Divide that column by 30 to get the (pgrX).</p>

<p>Look at each of the next four charts. This leads to the general equation of:</p>


<p>
<strong>
<em>
<p style="background-color:#82e2ff;">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  = ( { (=  [ *pair.PSleft + *pair.PSright ] / 30 ) - *fam } / 30 ) =3D (pgrX)</p>

<p>Go back to the starting premise of *wildcard ( *1 , *3 , *7 , *9 ) and *fam (*fam01 , *fam 07 , . . . , *fam29).
