<h1>Chapter 1700 in the neighborhood of show try</h1>



<p>Sort back in the non-prime. Looking at all prime together
with non-prime and using the 1/7th rule as an overlay to the MOD() function ,
another pattern emerges.</p>

<p>Any number PS that is non-prime will have at least two cells
painted by the MOD() function within the *ratio 1/7. The first being one (1)
and the other(s) a different factor of PS. They will be under the limit imposed
by the 1/7th *ratio.</p>

<h2>1701 'try' 4</h2>



<p>Here is 'try' =3D 4. The PS is from 28 to 34 inclusive. There are two prime numbers 29 and 31 inside the 'try' ; the (g7).</p>



<p></p>
<img src="../scr/Picture312.png">
<p></p>



<p>Note that 29 and 31 each have only one zero and painted cell
under the limit. The rows for 28 , 30 , 32 , 33, and 34 all have at least two
zeros and painted cells.</p>

<h2>1702 'try' 9</h2>



<p>Here is 'try' =3D 9. The PS is from 63 to 69 inclusive. There is
one prime number 67 inside the 'try' ; the (g7).</p>



<p></p>
<img src="../scr/Picture314.png">
<p></p>



<p>Note that 67 has only one zero and painted cell. The rows
for 63 , 64 , 65 , 66 , 68 and 69 all have at least two zeros and painted cells.</p>



<p></p>

<p></p>




<h2>1703 'try' 12</h2>



<p>Here is 'try' = 12. The PS is from 84 to 90 inclusive. There
is one prime number 89 inside the 'try' ; the (g7).</p>



<p></p>
<img src="../scr/Picture316.png">
<p></p>



<p>Note that 89 has only one zero and painted cell. The rows
for 84 , 85 , 86 , 87 , 88 and 90 all have at least two zeros and painted cells.</p>



<p></p>
<img src="../scr/Picture317.png">
<p></p>



<h2>1704 'try' 15</h2>



<p>Here is 'try' =3D 15. The PS is from 105 TO 111 inclusive.
There are two prime numbers 107 and 109 inside the 'try' ; the (g7).</p>



<p></p>
<img src="../scr/Picture318.png">
<p></p>





<p>Note that 107 and 109 have only one zero and painted cell.
The rows for 105 , 106 , 108 , 110 , and 111 all have at least two zeros and painted cells.</p>

<h2>1705 show easy calc</h2>



<p>'Easy calc' will show all the solutions for all the
variables and formulas up to this point. Most important is the 'try' value. It
is a fence or rail that the other *fam (11 to 29) greater than *fam07 will not
cross. The opposite is *fam07 's *ratio is greater than the other *fam *ratio
(1/11 down to 1/29). It leaves *fam07 wedged between *fam01 and *fam11.</p>



<p></p>

<p></p>





<p>Input any PS and see the results. This is just another
playground to test the formulas and solutions.</p>

<h2>1706 try limit formula matrix</h2>



<p>An additional look at the *wildcard , *fam , *ratio and the
'try'. The next four charts are for *wildcards ; *1 , *3 , *7 and *9.</p>



<p></p>
<img src="../scr/Picture321.png">
<p></p>



<p>First is (g) the group , 'just another thirty away'.</p>

<p>Next is the PS set at 10 apart.</p>

<p>The formula is a substitution of the calculated values based in the *wildcard input.</p>

<p>Under the input are the all the numbers that end in the
*wildcard. Within a group (g) each value is +10 , and the next (g) is +30.</p>

<p>Inside the matrix are the calculated *fam. With conditional formatting ; sort out of view the unwanted and sort in the
view of wanted. All the conditional formatting is based on the base formula of [(PS - *fam) / 30] and the MOD() function.</p>

<p>The next two columns are the calculated *fam and PSL.</p>

<p>The *ratio 1/7 column is the 'try'. Test up to and including this number to find a factor for the PS. If no factor is found within this
limit , then PS is prime.</p>

<h3>Matrix *1</h3>

<h3>Matrix *3</h3>

<p></p>



<h3>Matrix *7</h3>



<p></p>
<img src="../scr/Picture324.png">
<p></p>



<h3>Matrix *9</h3>



<p></p>
<img src="../scr/Picture325.png">
<p></p>





<p>Go to the XLSX file and change the values to 1 , 3 , 7, or 9
; then see the results change. This is another view sewing together all the
values from *wildcard to *fam to PSL or (g) to 'try'. It supports the premise
of *wildcard. It also shows clearly that the next PS is 'just another thirty
away' from the previous or next.</p>

<h2>1707 'try' 134999</h2>



<p>Here is a large prime number 134999. There is a bracket of
seven numbers with a 'try'. Place the PS at the counter (cnt) of zero (0) and
subtract eight numbers and add eight numbers. Eight is one greater than seven ,
so at least one adjacent 'try' above and below will be visible. The focus of
the 'try' is in the red box cells. This is just another view showing 'try'.
There is something about the box of 'try' (g7). The 'try' is 1/7th of the PS ,
look at all the other non-primes within the same 'try' and see the factors
below the 'Factors' column.</p>

<h2>1708 'try' 1234570321</h2>



<p>Same thing for another large prime number 1234570321.
Compare all the non-primes 'in the neighborhood of' that show factors for less
than the *ratio of 1/7.</p>

<p>Here is the 'easy calc' for the prime 1234570321.</p>

<p></p>




<p>The significance of these examples is to show the limit of 'try' when looking for factors.</p>
