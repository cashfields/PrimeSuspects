<h1>Chapter 0070 Find Mod And Make *fam</h1>

<p>Looking at all numbers and focusing on the *wildcard (*1 , *3 , *7 , *9) to 
create *fam ( *fam01 , *fam07 , *fam11 , *fam13 , *fam17 ,
*fam19 , *fam23 , and *fam29 ) a clear pattern of all numbers can be derived.</p>

<p>By using the MOD() function we can look for factors easily.
Where MOD(PS,1) =30 and conditionally painting the cell yellow. Non-prime
numbers can be easily seen and sorted off.</p>

<p>Mod() with only odd numbers in column p. Column p-c is a painted color of prime numbers.</p>

<p>Sorting off all the even numbers and leaving just the odd numbers will create this chart.</p>

<p>Same list but the integer value of the square root of the ODD column is listed. </p>

<p>Right side of square root is redundant. Before I get too far
ahead of myself , the right side of the square root can be eliminated. It is
just the inverse of the left side. An example is (7 x 11) the same as (11 x 7).
They are mirror images on both sides of the square root.</p>

<p>2 And 5 Are Out</p>

<p>At this point let ''s look at 2 (two) and 5 (five).</p>

<p>>Both of these</span> number are each a one shot ; they only occur once as the least significant digit. 
It is extraneous data , sort them out.</p>

<p>Two (2) is the only even number prime number. All subsequent
even numbers are just a multiple of two (2). There will never be any number
that is *2 greater than 2 that can be prime.</p>

<p>Five (5) is the same as two (2) there is only one prime that
will end with a five. All the rest are multiples of five (5). There will never
be any number that is *5 greater than five (5) that can be prime.</p>

<p>Remember *wildcard numbers.</p>



<p><strong>How And Why Can We Discard Numbers?</strong></p>

<p>In the real world we make all kinds of different sorts for
different data ; different rules ; for all kinds of different situations.</p>

<hr>
<p>The first that comes to mind is the old MS-DOS "dir" command. 
We could sort files with &quot;<u>dir a*.com</u>&quot; - give me a
list of all files that starts with &quot;a&quot; , and</span> are
any length or values and have a &quot;.com&quot; extension.</p>


<p>Next , in a TSO Mainframe File Edit , is a command like
&quot;<u>sort 12 15 a 23 34 d 16 18 a</u>&quot; - sort columns 12 to 15
ascending , and then 23 to 34 descending , and finally 16 to 18 ascending.</p>
