<h1>>Chapter 0130 Slope of Primes</h1>



<p>Next is a look at just prime numbers and calculating the slopes of the lines. 
The next series of arts and charts uses a list of prime numbers. 
There is a comparison of the prime numbers and the solution to the PSL
(<u>P</u>rime <u>S</u>uspect <u>L</u>evel).</p>



<p>This is a forced list of only the prime numbers that belong to *1. 
There are two columns for that , *fam01 and *fam11. The PSL is calculated for prime number. 
If the solution is an integer , then it belongs to that *fam. 
Note that there are gaps or missing integer values in both columns.</p>

<p>This is a forced list of only the prime numbers that belong to *3.</p>

<p>This is a forced list of only the prime numbers that belong to *7.</p>

<p>This is a forced list of only the prime numbers that belong to *9.</p>

<p>The interesting portion of all this data: Where are the numbers that are missing in the PSL values?</p>

<p>These are the solution values for the *fam formulas.</p>

<p>Here is a graph of the prior data. Just the eight *fam formulas are graphed with the data points.</p>

<p></p>
  

<p>Now all thirty *fam from *fam00 to *fam29 and the solutions for the formulas. 
The *fam values highlighted in blue are the eight *fam formulas that are sorted in and the 
focus of searching for prime numbers.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Here are all the *fam equations. The eight keeper (sorted in) formulas are in color. 
The excluded (sorted out) are all in black.</p>

<p>This image shows all the data points for prior graphs. The slope of all the lines is thirty.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>



<p>Since all the slopes are thirty , the lines are straight.
The question becomes , where are the missing values from the from the list of prime numbers?</p>

<p>I looked and decided the missing numbers are the non-prime
that were sorted out of the forced lists above. The next step is to sort the
non-primes back into the list. All numbers will then be viewed.</p>

<p>The next chapter on factors will bind the prime and non-prime numbers.</p>
