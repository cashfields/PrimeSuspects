<h1>Chapter 1500 Honey Numbers</h1>

<p>
While looking again at ratio vs square root data in the 1400 chapters , I created a new XLS file to compare some data. 
<br>
I was trying to compare 1/7 of a PS (Prime Suspect) to its square root.
<br>
I finnished dinner , cleaned the kitchen and was feeling a little sugar low , I took two teaspoons of honey to perk me up. 
<br>
This is the chart I was attempting to do some additional validation with new data.
</p>

<p>
<br>
As I was testing some small portions of the square root function , when it jumped out at me. I saw a new pattern with 'just another 30 away'

</p>f sq vs percent crossing data</p>
<br>
<p> The *fam are listed in the first eight columns (f01 to f29). Look at column f01 , each row is 'just another 30 away'.
<br>
The 'cnt' column is really (g) [group].
<br> Next , are two columns as a <u>pair</u> for each *fam. 
<br>
<strong>
<em>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; a) *f01 / 1 = all the numbers divided by the base number of the *fam = ratio</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; b) square root (sq) of the *fam </p>
</em>
</strong>
<p>
I noticed in column "sq 19" some integer values , I reconized these as some of the PS (Prime Suspects). 
<br>But where were the rest of them ? 
<br>At the time *fam01 was not in the table , no point looking for a ratio of a number divided by 1.
<br>
So , I added data and columns for *fam01. The rest of the PS values showed up. 
<br>
The unique thing is only in *fam01 and *fam19 could I see integer values.
<br>
There were no integer values in any of the other *fam (f07 , f11 , f13 , f17 , f23 , f29) ; only a decmial value could be found.
<br>
It is a littlr bit of an eye test , only looking in the blue painted columns are the square roots.
<br>
The integer values are further marked with a square box around the data.

In the rest of this chapter I will display some very unique data.
</p>

<p>
In the next image is the standard data of *fam and each value is 'just another 30 away' from the previous value.
<br>
Note column C and the *fam of 'f01' starts at 1 , then 31 , then 61 ; these are all PS values.
Look at each column and it is the same +30.
