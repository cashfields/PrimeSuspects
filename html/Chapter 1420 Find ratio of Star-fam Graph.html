<h1>Chapter 1420 Find *ratio of Star-fam Graph</h1>



<p>Staying with the largest *ratio of 1/7 or .0142857 that is
less than <span classGramE>1 ; as a limit. Below are the data and some
graphs. First , is a sample of prime numbers , then of non-prime , and then the
combination of both. The data in the charts is a PS , then (PS * 1/7) , and PS
squared (PS * PS).</p>

<p>The purpose is to show the function of a rail or limit of one-seventh (1/7). 
<br>Back in the prior two chapters <a href "../Chapter 1300 Make 05 c Enhanced">Chapter 1300 Make 05 c Enhanced</a> 
<br>and <a href "../Chapter 1400 Find ratio of Star-fam">Chapter 1400 Find *ratio of Star-fam</a> ; 
<br>the data showed the red square around the group (g) , then in the *ratio the solution. There are lots of pieces to the
puzzle , just some more.</p>

<p>Let s chart and graph the data for primes and non-primes
separate and combined view for comparison. Since the square around the group
(g) or any PS is PS squared (PS *PS).</p>

<p>What is one-seventh of the square?</p>

<p>Does it make a limit?</p>

<p>Is there another hidden pattern ?</p>





<p>This chart is the PS of only prime numbers. Sort in only
primes calculate the square and 1/7th of the square.</p>

<p>This chart is the PS of only non-prime numbers. Sort in only
non-primes. Same calculations as above.</p>



<p></p>

<p></p>





<p>This chart is the PS of both prime and non-prime numbers.
The combination. Sort together all PS.</p>

<p></p>





<p>This graph is the prime numbers alone.</p>



<p></p>

<p></p>





<p>This graph is the non-prime numbers alone.</p>

<p></p>



  




<p>Here is the combination of both sets of data. The square of
the prime numbers is highlighted with red markers. Also , the markers have the
callout with the value of PS and the value of the square. The line of limit
1/7 has the callout of the prime and one-seventh of the square.</p>
