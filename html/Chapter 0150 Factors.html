<h1>Chapter 0150 Factors</h1>


<p>This first chart lists all the *1 *wildcard numbers. The
formula to satisfy for *fam01 is [ 1 + n(30) ]. The columns in blue labeled as
D , E , F, and G are joining the prime and non-prime. Columns D and E are the
prime numbers that are a solution for *fam01. Columns F and G are the non-prime
numbers for the solution for *fam01. To the right in the yellow panel are the
factors for the non-prime numbers. They are placed in the column associated
with their *fam. There is also a sub-sort within the green factors column. 
The smallest factor is listed first and the larger is after the multiplication
symbol. Think of prepping the data for future sorts.</p>

<p>Later on , these factors will be grouped with the *fam value listed first. 
In the <a href="./Chapter 0200 From Chaos to Cosmos"><Chapter 0200 From Chaos to Cosmos></a>.

<p>The importance this chart is column G the MN (<u>m</u>issing
<u>n</u>umber) is the PSL (Prime Suspect Level). The *fam01 has now sown
together all *1 numbers (prime and non-prime) that satisfy *fam01 formula of: </p>

<p>PSL = 1 + n(30)</p>

<p>There are no gaps in counting numbers when n (column E) and
MN (column G) are joined together. The numbers are listed sequentially.</p>

<p>Columns E (n) and G (MN - <u>M</u>issing <u>N</u>umber) join primes and non-primes back together.</p>

<p>Here is the same chart for *fam13. That satisfy *fam13 formula of: </p>

<p>PSL = 13 + n(30)</p>

<p>Here is the same chart for *fam17. That satisfy *fam17 formula of: </p>

<p>PSL = 17 + n(30) </p>

<p>Here is the same chart for *fam19. That satisfy *fam19 formula of: </p>

<p>PSL = 19 + n(30)</p>

<p>Here is the same chart for *fam23. That satisfy *fam23 formula of: </p>

<p>PSL = 23 + n(30)</p>

<p>Here is the same chart for *fam29. That satisfy *fam29 formula of: </p>

<p>PSL = 29 + n(30)</p>

<p></p>



<p>Using the initial formula of:</p>

<p>PSL = (PS - *fam) / 30</p>

<p>Which can be converted to:</p>

<p>PSL = (PS - *fam) / 30 </p>

<p>PSL(30) = PS - *fam</p>

<p>PSL(30) + *fam = PS<o:p/o:p></p>

<p>PS = *fam + PSL(30)</p>

<p>Using the last version of the formula gives data for several charts that are a continuation where:</p>

<p>PSL = n = 0 to 119</p>

<p>This charts the eight *fam against all numbers. It displays
the solutions for each formula across the matrix. If it is an integer value ,
then it is the PSL. This is a curiosity view. It shows what is going on with
the numbers , and does the formula work at all levels.
The answer is yes , it is solid. The following four charts show the PSL grow
from 0 to 3. Look at the yellow cells with a border and an integer value.</p>
