<h1>Chapter 0100 Formulas</h1>



<p>All the data that we are looking for hovers around 0 +/- 1
or 5 +/- 2. This chapter will show the formulas for each *fam. Below is a
matrix of *fam there are four columns , one for each group. Within a group are
three formulas , each row separated by ten (10). The painted yellow cells are
divisible by three. The n column is the input to the formula. This list shows
all numbers that end as *1 , *3 , *7 , *9.</p>


<p>Iiii35</p>







<p>Below are the *fam that can be divided by three , the other
*fam are temporarily out of view. These will be sorted off.</p>

<p>Iiii36</p>







<p>Here now are the set of formulas that are sorted in. These
will be the focus in the search for primes. </p>

<p>Iiii37</p>









<p>This chart lists the solution to each formula for the value in the n column. 
Note how the value in each formula’s column grows by thirty for the next n value. </p>

<p>Iiii38</p>







<p>Here is a partial graph of the eight formulas for n from 0 to 3 , off the top edge.</p>

<p>Iiii39</p>







<p>Once again here are all thirty formulas with the green cells highlighting the 
keepers , or sort in. These thirty formulas will yield all numbers 
from -&#8734; (negative infinity) to +&#8734; (positive infinity). 
The value of the *fam is the value of the last two digits.</p>

<p>Iiii40</p>





<p>Here is just another view showing the solutions of the *fam
formulas satisfying negative and positive values. The smallest number of the
matrix in the top left corner , and the largest in the bottom right for each
matrix. Then jump to the next matrix: n + 1 going right. <span class=3DGram E>And ,</span> n – 1 going left.</p>

<p>Iiii41</p>



<p>This is a giant view of the matrix for any value high or low.</p>

<p>Iiii42</p>







<h2>*1</h2>



<p>This is a close-up view of the *1 and its sub-family’s formulas. Green are the keepers , sort in.</p>

<p>Iiii43</p>





<p>Here are the solutions for the formulas associated with *1.
The variable n is used three time inside a group of thirty numbers. 
Each solution value grows by ten as n is substituted into the formula. 
All the possible numbers that end in 1 (one) are created by the formulas.</p>

<p>Iiii44</p>



<p>Sorting the solutions by *fam and then by the solution value or n ; gives the following results. </p>

<p>Iiii45</p>

<h2>*3</h2>



<p>The following pages will show the same sorting and information for *3 and *7 and *9.</p>

<p>Iiii46</p>



<p>Iiii47</p>



<p>Iiii48</p>



<h2>*7</h2>



<p>Iiii49</p>




<p>Iiii50</p>



<p>Iiii51</p>



<h2>*9</h2>



<p>Iiii51</p>



<p>Iiii52</p>



<p>Iiii53</p>





<p>These last few pages have shown the formulas to calculate
numbers that are PS (<u>P</u>rime <u>S</u>uspects) , candidates to be a prime
number. Some additional information is gained as the result of the looking for any prime number.</p>

<p>Take any number , look at the last digit using the *wildcard
, subtract both *fam associated with the *wildcard , then divide those results
by thirty. Look to see if that result can be an integer value by applying the
MOD() function with one (1) as the test.</p>

<p>EX:</p>

<p>Pick any number. A big number 1234567</p>

<p>1234567 – 07 (*fam07) =3D 1234560</p>

<p>1234567 – 17 (*fam17) =3D 1234550</p>



<p>1234560 / 30 =3D 41152 (integer)</p>

<p>1234550 / 30 =3D 41151.666 (non-integer)</p>



<p>Three answers learned:</p>

<p>a)The number belongs to *fam07 (sorted in)</p>

<p>b)The PSL (<u>P</u>rime <u>S</u>uspect <u>L</u>evel) = 41152 in the pile</p>

<p>c)*fam17 is disqualified for this PS (sorted out)</p>
