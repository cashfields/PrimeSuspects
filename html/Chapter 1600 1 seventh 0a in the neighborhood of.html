<h1>Chapter 1600 1 seventh 0a in the neighborhood of</h1>



<p>Looking for a pattern , the sights were set too high. 
Using the square of PS was too large. Just taking the one-seventh of PS revealed much more.</p>


<p></p>

<p>This chart is the MOD() chart with the square and one-seventh of the square. 
It did not help fully. Close but not close enough.</p>



<p>Next is a refined scope still using one-seventh (1/7) but against PS as a limit.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>



<p>Let 's break down the pieces of the chart.</p>

<p]>PS is the list of all <u>P</u>rime <u>S</u>uspects ; prime and non-prime. </p>

<p>The sq is (PS * PS)</p>

<p>Next is *ratio 1/7 (0.142857) ; the value in the cells is (sq * 1/7).</p>

<p>"fraction" is (PS * 1/7).</p>

<p>group (g7) is the integer value of "fraction" [floor(fraction)]</p>



<p>Here is a close upof two group (g7) ; values of 5 and 6. 
The dark lines are highlighting the groups. The blue cells are PS going down or to the right.</p>

<p>There are two prime numbers in the (g7) =5 ; 37 and 41.
There are also two inside (g7) =6 ; 43 and 47.</p>

<p>"in the neighborhood of" ; all around the primes are
solutions to the MOD() function. Within each different (g7) group a solution
happens for non-primes before the limit of one-seventh consistently. </p>

<p>Next , "within reason" if a factor of PS is not found within
the limit of the (g7) =(0.142857) =(1/7) , then the number is prime.</p>

</p>

<p>is a sheet: "1602 fam07 0.142859 vertical" </p>

<p>that will calculate the numbers for a PS to find the maximum (g7). 
This will be the number of times to "try" to look for a factor. Below is a chart of the PS =61. </p>

<p>"try" =9. "try" nine times to find a factor , if none then the number is prime.</p>

<p>The input is the blue box. The *fam and PSL are on the
right. There are two (2) factors. 1/7th of PS is 8.714399 ; use the ceiling=
()
function to account for decimal and get to the next higher integer value. B=
elow
is the full chart of PS =61. Note the conditional color of yellow backgr=

and red font to highlight the factors. The light gray and dark font highlig=

the breakpoint of "try".</p>

<p>Try 6 times to find a factor.</p>


<p></p>

<p></p>




<h2>22 non-prime</h2>



<p>Not a *fam number. But the 1/7th still works ; "try" = 4.</p>


<p></p>
<img src="../scr/Picture295.png">
<p></p>



<h2>25 non-prime</h2>



<p>The only number to fail the 1/7th test. But any *fam05 has
already been sorted off. To include 25 and satisfy the 1/7t test "try" would
have to be bumped by +2 for all PS. It is a data exception ; and has been
sorted off (excluded) very early in the process. </p>

<p>The focus is *1 , *3 , *7 , *9 ; and all the *fam under them. </p>

<p>This is the table limit. Search any number between 0 and 63031
inclusive. 63031 has two factors ; is prime ; and the "try" =9005. Only need
to test 9005 times to look for a factor. The top , breakpoint , and bottom of
the 63031 charts are shown.</p>
