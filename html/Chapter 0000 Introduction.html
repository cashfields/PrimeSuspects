<p>‘just another thirty away’</p>



<p>
Prime numbers are a large multi-dimensional matrix with several overlays and sort rules.
<br>
Looking for prime numbers I have found unique patterns to sort off any non-prime solutions. 
<br>
It is based on the several steps.  The solution to finding all non-prime numbers will eventually lead to
sort out all the primes. Every day in the real world we sort things out. Blue marbles , red cars , large tulips , sunfish . . . 
</p>

<p>
The key here is all of mathematics is nothing more than one kind or another of a sort.
<br>
The simplest function of math f(x) = ?

<br>
Whatever satisfies something is <u>sorted in</u>. Whatever does not satisfy something is <u>sorted out</u>.
</p>



<p>A few simple definitions and instructions first.</p>

<p>A prime number is only divided by one (1) and itself.</p>

<p>A non-prime (composite) has additional factors besides itself and one.</p>

<p>For the most part integer math will be integer used throughout.</p>

<p>The term ‘PS’ stands for the <u>P</u>rime <u>S</u>uspect. The number in question.</p>

<p>The term ‘*wildcard’ stands for a number of any magnitude.</p>

<p>The last digit is primary focus</p>

<p>Read *wildcard as ‘star-wildcard’</p>

<p>The term *fam (*family) is a group of related numbers.</p>

<p>*fam are subsets of *wildcard</p>

<p>Read the term ‘*fam’ as ‘star-fam’.</p>

<p>The term ‘PSL’ (<u>P</u>rime <u>S</u>uspect <u>L</u>evel) is the integer of the equation PSL = ( PS - *fam ) / 30. 
Where the solution is a non-decimal remainder.</p>

<p>The term ‘subXXfamNN’ are the unique sub-keys to *fam.
This term has two directions implied.</p>

<p>First – ‘sub’ the downhill direction *fam found.</p>

<p> XX – the family number - indicating a *fam of PS going downhill.</p>

<p>*famNN - indicating a sub-key going right - toward the square of PS.</p>

<p>The term ‘*ratio’ is a percentage or ratio.</p>

<p>‘*ratio’ is a boundary.</p>

<p>Read *ratio as ‘star-ratio’.</p>

<p>‘(g)’ is a group of numbers in a block of thirty.</p>

<p >‘(g7)’ is a group of numbers in a block of seven.</p>

<p></p>try’ is the limit to look for factors.</p>

<p>The next term is ‘just another thirty away’ within a *fam or a sub-key ; 
each next test value is thirty (30) away. Each next , or any next PS (Prime Suspect) 
is ‘just another thirty away’ from the prior or next PS.</p>

<p>The term ‘within reason’ is it will be hard to prove otherwise.</p>

<p>Finally , ‘in the neighborhood of’ relates to close  by numbers to determine a range and/or group and/or limit.</p>

<p>The ‘*’ star character cannot be used in file names or tab names ; so , some usage ’s names will not be fully 
consistent throughout the book. 
The ‘*’ may be substituted with ‘star’ or even dropped. Same for any other special characters like a slash ‘/’.</p>

<p>Viewing the arts and charts the Excel file name and  tab name is specified on the top ; 
this will allow easy cross-reference back to the files.</p>

<p>This document is filled with many charts loaded with data , the reader needs to read and watch the numbers as 
the flow moves towards the final solution. Each chapter is a building block to the next.</p>

<p>‘p’ can mean prime ; and ‘^p’ and ‘e’ can mean non-prime</p>

<p></p>Using *wildcard (*1 , *3 , *7 , *9) to create *fam ( *fam01 , *fam07 , *fam11 , *fam13 , *fam17 , *fam19 , *fam23 , and *fam29 ) a clear
pattern of <u>all</u> numbers can be derived.</p>

<p>The search for simple method of identifying primes involves
several sets of sorts ; sort-out , sort-in. Sort back together again. 
In the end using the sorting of <strong><u>data and formulas</u></strong> will reveal a 
multi-dimensional array of data that exists with different rules at different
levels. Treat prime numbers as just data. The steps included will allow non-primes
to be eliminated and therefore only a prime can be identified as the answer.
This will not project the next prime but will <u>reduce</u> the steps to
identifying prime vs. non-prime.</p>

<p>This document is an intensive study of data using numerous arts and charts ; spend time reviewing the charts data as one chapter leads=
 to the next. Less words more data. Each chart has the ‘sheetname’ and ‘filename’ in the top left corner. 
 This allows easy tracking of the charts back to the supporting EXCEL documents. </p>


<p>The size of the EXCEL files is a limiting factor to allow easy upload and download for anyone.</p>
