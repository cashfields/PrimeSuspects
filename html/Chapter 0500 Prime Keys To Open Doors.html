<h1>Chapter 0500 Prime Keys To Open Doors</a></h1>



<p>This chapter will take the rules from the eight equations in
the prior chapter and then apply the data graphically to show physical keys.
<br>The first chart is all eight formulas ; followed by the *pairs combinations.</p>



<p>This chart represents the rules in the shape of a key. Think just like a door key and lock. 
<br>Note the symmetry and note the value of one (1) moving from left to right. As the other values also shift.</p>

<p>Here is the *pairs of *fam01 and *fam29. The keys are represented both horizontally and vertically. 
<br>Notice the symmetry , balance , and the values.</p>

<p>Here is the *pairs of *fam07 and *fam23. The keys are represented both horizontally and vertically. 
<br>Notice the symmetry , balance , and the values. Note that 1 has indexed one position to the interior.</p>

<p>Here is the *pairs of *fam11 and *fam19. The keys are represented both horizontally and vertically. 
<br>Notice the symmetry , balance , and the values.</p>

<p>Here is the *pairs of *fam13 and *fam17. The keys are represented both horizontally and vertically. 
<br>Notice the symmetry , balance , and the values.</p>

<p>There is a dance with the prime numbers. 
<br>A slow even , methodical , and symmetric dance as the *wildcard numbers grow. 
<br>And , then as the *fam grows. 
<br>Followed by the offset of the "just another thirty away". There are a few more twists and turns.</p>
