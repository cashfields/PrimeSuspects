<h1>Chapter 1500 Honey Numbers c</h1>

<p> 
Since the only two families (*fam01 and *fam19) present integer values , what else is hidden ?
<br> 
What else can be revealed ? 
<br>
Spinning off all the extraneous data , and narrowing the focus to only *fam01 and *fam19 
<br>will present addition unique data.
<br>
Here is the unfiltered data again.

<p>
This is the two families (*fam01 and *fam19) cleaned up , with no extraneous data.
<br>
The "just another 30 away" values are in columns C and D (blue).
<br>
The  "sq root" are in columns E and F (gold).
<br>
Followed by the "hit chart" in columns G and H (green).
<br>
"sum" is the summation of the "hit chart" column I.
<br>
"famxx" is the integer value from the "sq root" columns.
<br>
The column K is "f the (g)" (find the (g)).
<br>
The last column M is "fam" which will be used to sort the data again.

<p>
The next set of images just uses some arrows to help map the data , it is just a visual quick check.
<br>
It is just "gun sighting" the data.  What is common , what is unique ?
<br>
This is the compressed view.
<br>
The two blue boxes separated by a black line are fam13 and fam17 , with the black line representing the value of 15.
<br>
Fifteen is the mid point of all the *fam numbers within a (g).
<br>
The long black line separates each (g).

<p>
The next view is expanded to show the true distance between values. 
<br>
The arrow lines follow the targets from number to number.
<br>
This is (g)0 on the top.


<p></p>

</p>

<p>
This is (g)1
<br>
The arrow lines still follow the targets from number to number.
<br>



<p></p>

<p></p>

</p>


<p>
This is (g)0 , (g)1 , and (g)2
<br>
The arrow lines still follow the targets from number to number.

<p>
This is *fam01.
<br>
Sorting the table by column L and separating into a separate sheet by *fam , will allow for a closer inspection of the data.
<br>
Column I (famxx) shows each value as "just another 30 away" ; column J (f the (g)) grows by 1.
<br>
Now for the really fun part. Look carefully at column B (f01) the 10"s digit repeats as a group every 5th value.
<br>
Column O (mid 2nd last) does a mid(start,len) on column B , which yields the 2nd to last character.
<br> 
We have : 0 , 6 , 2 , 8 , 4 - a repeating pattern. 

<p></p>
