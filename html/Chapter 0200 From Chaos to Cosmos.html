<h1>Chapter 0200 From Chaos to Cosmos</h1>

<span style=3D'mso-bookmark:_Hlk89567784'></span>

<p></p>

<p>This chapter is the turning point for all the pre-sorting
that has been done to get the data prepped for the next sort. Here is the
transformation from what appears to no order for prime numbers. Using the
formulas and the data there is a regular pattern to prime numbers. This is the
pinnacle of all the sorts.</p>

<p>There will be three charts for each *fam. As an example ,
the names of each sheet in the XLSX will only change by the *fam number.</p>

<p>The *fam01 names follow:</p>



<p>The "a" sheet is taken from the factors chapter. The order
of the factors is very important. Small factor first , times symbol , and then
the larger factor second. Treat the factors as string data.</p>

<p>The "b" sheet is the same as the "a" sheet , but the data is
pasted as values. No formulas. The *fam list is in no order , the same for the
PSL. The factors look to grow in a reasonable fashion.</p>

<p></p>

<p><u>Finally , the "c" sheet is sorted by *fam first , then by
the PSL.</u> This unique sort brings all the prime and non-primes into full
order. Cosmos. Next , the factors have become distinguished and there is more
order within each *fam. Abracadabra , absolute magic !</p>

<p>This is the complete order based on this sort. The secret of
primes and non-primes is showing itself. Let's  dissect what the data is shows. This
last sort has left enormous telltale signs.</p>

<p>First , all *fam01 are sorted together. Next the PSL or MN
are sorted in sequential order and grow by value of one (1). This leaves by
default the second factors growing larger , each second factor grows by thirty.
Remember , the *fam is assigned by one of eight unique formulas. </p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>The second group for *fam01 are the numbers affiliated with
*fam07 solutions. The middle column is the PSL or NM. The far-right column is
the second factor growing by thirty.</p>

<p>There is order here.</p>

<h2>*fam01</h2>

<p></p>

<p></p>
<img src="../scr/Picture79.png">
<p></p>

<p>The starting numbers in each group have a relation to
thirty. The sum of name *fam and the 2nd factors thirty . 
The *fam creates *pairs to make thirty.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<h2>*fam07</h2>

<p></p>

<p>Let's move forward and look at the next *fam. Next is *fam07 , there will be the same three a , b , c sheets for this family.</p>

<p>The sheet a the calculation formulas , b =3D chaos (the pasted data) , and <u>c =3D cosmos (the sorted data).</u></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>First , all *fam01 are sorted together. Next the PSL or MN are sorted in sequential 
order and grow by value of seven (7). This leaves by default the second factors growing 
larger , each second factor grows by thirty again. Remember , the *fam is assigned 
by one of eight unique formulas. The significance is the prior *fam01 the data grew by one. </p>

<p></p>

<p></p>
<img src="../scr/Picture83a.png">
<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>The second group for *fam07 are the numbers affiliated with *fam07 solutions. 
The middle column is the PSL or NM. The far-right column is the second factor growing by thirty. 
Just like the prior image the middle column grows by seven (7).</p>


<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>Important point is to notice the <u>starting number</u> of
the PSL in the grouped *fam. Here inside *fam07 there are pairs. This will lead
us to *pairs later. Note the balance in the table to make thirty.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>
<img src="../scr/Picture89.png">
<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>*fam01 and *fam29 both start with 3. Adds up to 6. *fam07
and *fam23 are 0 and 6. Adds up to 6. *fam11 and *fam19 are 5 and 1. Adds up to
6. As does *fam13 and *fam17 are 4 and 2. Watch the starting number and test
your own sum in the follow charts. </p>

<p>Also , the *fam names are paired as are the last two digits
of the factor's column. Both will add up to thirty. There is symmetry in the PSL
and factors columns.</p>

<p>The starting numbers of each group have a relation to thirty. 
The sum of the 2nd factors is thirty. As is the *fam name. 
Note how the second factor pairs are moving. 
The *pairs are moving around with each *fam and the solutions.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Here is a highlighted markup of *fam23 and its solutions.
The starting element of the solutions and the lines are painted to show the joining of *pairs.</p>

<p>The *fam *pairs add up to thirty</p>

<p>The sum of all the PSL is equal.</p>

<p>The second factor sum is thirty , or a multiple of thirty.</p>

<p>Look for these characteristics in all the following charts. There is symmetry everywhere.</p>
