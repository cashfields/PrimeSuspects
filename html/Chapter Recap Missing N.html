<h1>Chapter Recap Missing N</h1>

<p>Several things need to be recapped at this point.</p>

<pSorting off 2 , 3 , 5 and evens gives a set of numbers *wildcard ; *1 , *3 , *7 , and *9.</p>

<p></p>The *wildcard numbers each have three subset formulas. 
One formula of each *wildcard can be sorted off because it is divisible by three.</p>

<p>Using the MOD() function to easily show factors.</p>

<pA clear pattern by which PS can be color coded is created by the *fam.</p>

<p>The focus of looking for primes is a general formula of : PS = *fam + n(30) where n = PSL.</p>

<p>Or PSL = (PS - *fam)/30.</p>

<p>The *wildcard and *fam formulas show a path to look for prime numbers.</p>

<p>With the data filtered and sorted , there is a clear view of the distance between primes and non-primes.</p>

<p>The magic number is a distance of thirty between any PS within a *fam. 
This will be very important later.</p>

<p>The slope of a line for a *fam is thirty , so all prime (p) and non-prime (^p) lay on the same line for given *fam.</p>

<pNext , the factors of non-prime <u>must</u> be in a specific order for later sorts. Small first , larger second. </p>

<p></p>Last , the data is sorted by the *fam first and then the PSL. Data goes from chaos to cosmos.</p>

<p>In the end the cosmos version of the data reveals several unique pieces of information. Here *fam07 is used as an example.</p>

<p> a) The factors are sub-grouped together by *fam.</p>

<p> b) The PSL grows by the value of the *fam07.</p>

<p> c) The factors second digit grows by 30.</p>

<p>The PS grows by *fam07 times 30 = 210. The diff is always *fam times 30 per subgroup.</p>

<p>The column labeled ‘factors’ is a textual representation the two factors ; the sort is *fam first , then by the PSL. It brings into sort order the text of the ‘factors’ column. </p>

<p>Included below is a marked-up copy of the *fam07 cosmos sheet.</p>
